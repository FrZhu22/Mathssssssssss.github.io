		<h3> Mayans and aliens </h3>
		<font face="Agency FB">
		The Mayans were obviously influenced by aliens. There is no other possible way that the Mayans
		could have built such advanced structures and created an incredibly advanced language. Then, the
		Mayans just basically dissapeared. The only possible anwser is: ALIENS wiped them out. 
		I'll start off with how the Mayan's shaped their skulls. Skull binding was common among 
		Mayans. All these professors say that Mayan's did this because they believed that everything was made
		of corn.

		First, the Mayan civilization did not have a "corn" god as their "main" god(because that
		would be corny HA HA). But, the Mayan staple crop was corn. Why did Mayan's depend on corn?
		The only anwser is that aliens' heads were kind of like corn. Therefore, Mayans planted lots of
		corn and shaped their heads like corn. Also, because the aliens were so much more advanced than the
		Mayans, Mayans worshipped them as gods. That is how Mayans figured out everything was made from corn
